# CS 2 Server Manager & Admin Panel

This is an in-dev project created to solve two problems tournament operators face when running CS2 tournaments.

 - There is no actively maintained free-to-use lightweight server management software
    - HLSW is difficult to acquire, no longer has online functionality and hasn't been updated since 2011
  - The needs of admin teams at events is often at odds with the majority of server/admin software available
    - A tool built by admins for admins will make non-intrusive management of tournament servers without relying on invasive plugins easy to set up in seconds.

This tool is currently in early development and unlikely to work out-of-the-box for most users. This monorepo should be considered a proof of concept that will eventually be refactored to work not only in a LAN environment but also over the internet with zero environment setup needed.

Plug in your server IPs, hit go and the platform's ready to roll immediately.
